1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We got a Russian dressing.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is tasting delicious, wow.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Did I fool them?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to "Mythical Kitchen,"

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
where dreams become food.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A portion of today's video is sponsored by "Bright Cellars,"

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but more on them later.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
All right, this one goes out to all our neighbors

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in the Great White North up there

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because "Mythical Kitchen,"

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we have been ignoring the Canadian additions

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to the culinary world for far too long.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Never before have we featured a Nanaimo bar,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a single Tiger Tail has never been inside this kitchen.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Not once have these hallowed halls seen a blueberry grunt.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But today all that changes because we're making poutine.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're doing it "Mythical Kitchen" style.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A lot of Canadians probably be pretty mad about this one.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sorry, not sorry.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll be breaking this down into three easy steps.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can snag the time codes right there.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We also got a full written recipe down in the description.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can also check out the latest episode

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of our podcast hosted by me and Nicole,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
it's called "A Hot Dog is a Sandwich."

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can get it wherever you get your podcasts.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's get cooking, eh?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Remember how I said Canadians are going to be mad?

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, we're starting our poutine

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
with making our own fresh made corned beef.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me explain it so you understand.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So poutine if you are not familiar,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
is the Canadian delicacy that are French fries covered

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
in a deeply darkened brown beef gravy and cheese curds.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They're like the squeaky cheese curds

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
almost similar to fresh mozzarella,

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and a lot of people will say it is not poutine

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
if it has meat in it,

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it has other stuff.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We're going to break almost every single rule of poutine.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Canada, come find me.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Anyways, so we're making our corned beef.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We are doing a Reuben-inspired poutine.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Reuben is a combination of corned beef,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
One of my favorite things in the world

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and I believe it is my birthright

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
as a Jewish American to eat this style of poutine.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So we're adding salt to a brine.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're also adding coriander seeds.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We've got a bunch of aromatics.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Juniper berries and some clove.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Corned beef ain't got no corn in it.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A little bit of false advertising there.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It comes from like a weird German mistranslation.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's essentially just like pickled beef

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that is pickled with nitrate salt,

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
AKA pink curing salt, AKA Prague powder,

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
which to me sounds like a really cool improvised weapon.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So we're going to add that nitrate powder into there.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All that's going to do,

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
it's going to help give the beef a nice pink tinge.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It also is just going to deepen the preservation of it.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So like nitrate salts are literally just there

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to stop bacterial growth on meat.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But now it gives it that tasty little pink snap.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Peppercorns.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Got a lot of stuff going in here.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Grab mustard seeds too.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We got a little bit of ground ginger

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and then some whole allspice berries.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We got a cinnamon stick.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Jason Kidd, almost.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We're adding a cinnamon stick

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and we got a couple of bay leaves going in there,

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and now a little bit of brown sugar just for sweetness.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So what we're gonna do.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're going to take just our big old giant beating stick

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and we're going to add that to our,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
can we say add that to the pot?

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Like that's an ingredient?

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Like there's yeah,

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
we're going to let the metal boil out.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Gives the beef a nice flavor.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's how they did it in Cork, Ireland

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
back in the 18th century.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Trevor sent me a link to a really fantastic article

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
about the history of corned beef.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Salt tax was lower in Ireland than it was England,

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
so all the corned beef manufacturing ended up in Ireland.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you, Trevor.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
All right,

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
so we're just going to get all that salt

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and all that sugar dissolved in the brine right there.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then we're going to take all of our ice.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is a brisket, AKA, a breast of cow.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You got chicken breast, you got cow breast.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Basically, it kind of like,

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you know, rests right there on the cow.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Really fantastic.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why am I holding these like that?

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They were fine on the table but the camera can see it all.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Anyways, take that big old cow breast and put that in there.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then I'm going to dump all this ice in there just

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to cool it down 'cause we don't want

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to cook the beef right now.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And then the most important part

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
of this is you gotta shimmy it.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is shaken corned beef.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Actually, shaken beef is a great Vietnamese dish.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ADD's firing today, boys.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We're going to pop this.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We're cornin' our beef.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So we're going to let this sit for a minimum of five days,

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
a maximum of, I think kind of forever.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean, probably don't do it more than like two weeks.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:60,000
We're not trying to dry age this beef.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We're gonna let it sit in the fridge.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We did ours for about seven days.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So let that happen.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let the cornin' process take over

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and then I'll see you in like a week.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
All right, now that we've corned some beef,

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I want to let you know that this portion

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
of today's video is sponsored by Bright Cellars.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Bright Cellars is a monthly wine subscription service

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
that helps you discover the wine you love

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
conveniently shipped directly to your door.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now because I'm all about discovering flavors

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that are new to me,

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I love the way Bright Cellars features varieties

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
from around the globe and you can learn about them

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
from their handy dandy education cards

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that are included with every wine.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I mean, so much of enjoying wine can feel like a snobby club

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
with rules and jargon that's hard to understand,

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so I can really get behind how Bright Cellars breaks it down

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to easy to recognize tasting notes,

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
suggested pairings,

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
best serving temperature, and origin.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now whether you're a wine pro

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
or a novice who needs a little bit of nudgin',

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
taking Bright Cellars seven question quiz is a great way

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to analyze your taste profile

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and find wines that you're guaranteed to love.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Get this, get this!

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If you don't like one of the bottles in your box,

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Bright Cellars will replace it for free, no problem.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now I'm super, super excited to try this here

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Chenin Blanc Andaluz,

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
which just came in my latest Bright Cellars box.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's a very cool South African wine.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's my whole family's from

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and I love the card specifies it's great

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
for brunch on the patio 'cause he know how much

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I love my before noon wine.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000

00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thanks again to Bright Cellars

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:60,000
for sponsoring that portion of today's video.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now back to the beef.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, congratulations.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You've taken over a week to make a plate of fries.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So we got the corned beef out of here.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm just going to jump in and fish it out.

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Ooh, that's cold.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We're going to give it a one, a two,

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
a how do you do.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We're going to slap that

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
into a deep casserole dish right here.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So we still want all the aromatics in here.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You think about corned beef,

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you think about all those lovely flavors.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The juniper, the allspice, and the mustard.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We're going to take the brine.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We don't want to use this as our braising liquid

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
'cause it is a hecka salty.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Did I say hecka?

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, I've started talking incredibly Mormonly

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
since doing this cooking show.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We're going to strain off all of our aromatics in here.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We're going to get some fresh water braising.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So we're going to take that.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You got all that mustard seed,

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
all that cinnamon in there.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm just going to scatter this across our beef.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now we got to get some root veg in there too

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
because we are eventually going

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to be making a dark gravy out of this corned beef

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to go on our poutine.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:61,000
So we're going to scatter some celery in there.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We got a fair amount of onions.

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Onion is French for onion.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We got a little bit of carrot.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then now we got just a little bit more salt,

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
just to season up that liquid

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
'cause that's going to create our gravy.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then we're going to palm heel strike a couple of garlics,

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
so rapid fire two hand actions.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Ai, ai, ai, ai.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then we're gonna get between three and five cloves

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
of garlic on the floor.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sorry.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now we're just gonna pop that into our,

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
what is this called?

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
A beef loaf.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We're going to take some fresh water,

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
pop that on top.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What I'm going to do,

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
we want to cover it with enough water

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to like barely, barely submerge.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's not quite a braise,

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
not quite a slow boil,

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and then we're going to wrap it

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
in just a whole lot of tin foil.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We're gonna cook this low and slow.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We're going six hours at 300 degrees.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you thought the waiting a week to make fries was bad,

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
at this point, like the extra six hours,

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
what does that really do to you?

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So pop all this tin foil over it,

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
into the oven, six hours she goes.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Occupy yourself, you know, pick up a new hobby.

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey, you know, have you ever done crochet, scrimshaw?

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Can't talk enough about how much scrimshaw changed my life.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That was a lie.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Never scrimshawed a single thing.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is this leaking?

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Am I leaking?

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Uh oh, oh God.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ah, just put it in the oven.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Who cares?

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm gonna go ahead and take the corned beef out of the oven.

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's been seven days and six hours

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
since we started making these French fries.

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Annalise has been slowly killing me

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
like death by a thousand cuts

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
with puns that only half make sense

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
if you slow it down and turn on the subtitles.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So thank you Annalise, for that,

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
for improving my life.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's take a look at this here corned beef.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This looks all nice and squishy.

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Nice and squishy is what we're going for.

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You want to poke your corned beef.

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What you're looking for is to see if you can poke it.

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can.

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So we gotta make a gravy now.

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:60,000
This is the bones of the poutine.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:61,000
There is no poutine without gravy.

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We're going to use all that braising liquid

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
from the corned beef.

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Honestly, if give it a good huff,

258
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you're getting all the aromatics in there.

259
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're getting that allspice, that cinnamon.

260
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That smells freaky, that just smells good, man.

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
My dad used to make us corned beef and cabbage,

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
like all year around because we'd buy like 50 pounds

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
of corned beef around March 'cause it was real cheap

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and we'd just keep it in the freezer.

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I absolutely love this dish.

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Right now we're going to make a bit of a darker roux.

267
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This isn't like a dark roux,

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
like the Cajun dark roux.

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We're not taking it that deep

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that you start a gumbo with,

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
where you like really burn the flour.

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But we are trying to get a fair amount of toast on it.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So typically if you're making a cream sauce, right?

274
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You want like what's called a blonde roux,

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
which is you're mixing the flour

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
with the butter just until it's like nice

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and kind of rich enough to add the milk in there

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
with the flour being cooked.

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What we're going to do is we're going

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to crank the heat up on this

281
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and we're going to stir it continually

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
until it becomes super brown.

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That way when we add all

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
of this corned beef braising liquid to it,

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
it should turn a nice deep rich color

286
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
with a deep rich flavor.

287
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Now we've got to wait a little bit more.

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
More scrimshaw.

289
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Someone give me some whale bones and a little etcher.

290
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I got a scene between a sailor

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and a manatee I wanna scrimshaw.

292
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Actually, I've been stirring this for about 10 to 12 minutes

293
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and you see it's got this like awesome,

294
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I dunno, chestnut brown color.

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That looks really fantastic.

296
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It smells, all nice and fragrant.

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So now I'm going to take some of this corned beef liquid.

298
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Slap that all over.

299
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Get this burning liquid pot over here.

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm just going to dip down my ladle into this,

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
get some broth.

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Then we're gonna add it to this and stir it up,

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and you see it should act like a roux

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and just make it.

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I said it should act like a roux,

306
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it is a roux.

307
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then that's going to make it nice and thick.

308
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Just gonna add liquid gradually.

309
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You see it's becoming a lovely color right there.

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can always add a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it

311
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
but we do have all that roux in there as like a nice paste.

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Now.

313
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:60,000
One sec, give me a second.

314
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:61,000
Gonna chop up some corned beef and get it in there.

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I didn't plan on this.

316
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, didn't work.

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Here we go.

318
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is a smarter way to do it.

319
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, I'm going to drain some

320
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
of the beef juice a little bit.

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's some valuable beef juice, though.

322
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm gonna start hacking into this.

323
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You always want to cut across the grain on the corned beef.

324
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Give it a try.

325
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh God, it's really good.

326
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, oh yeah.

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's good stuff, man.

328
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean, honestly, this is absolute.

329
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean, aces corned beef.

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's cooked to perfection.

331
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
All the aromatics are in there.

332
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It is super, super salty.

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There we go.

334
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We just want a little bit of meat in this.

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We don't want to go like,

336
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
you know, this isn't a meat dish.

337
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is a fries dish.

338
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is poutine at the end of the day.

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm just going to chop up a little bit of this corned beef,

340
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
just to get some texture,

341
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
some extra flavor in there.

342
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm gonna add this to the gravy.

343
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Another five minutes.

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is going to tighten up

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and let's put our stamp on this poutine.

346
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I got the Annalise disease now.

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Depending on when you've joined in on the video,

348
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
we're on day eight or nine

349
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
of making a plate of French fries,

350
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
what would sell for $9 as an appetizer

351
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
before your normal meal comes.

352
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Welcome back.

353
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We got stuff.

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Check this out.

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is a big 'ole brown corned beef gravy.

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Super excited about that.

357
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We got French fries.

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
These were made using the exclusive cook food good method

359
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
as seen in the cook food good series.

360
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Not a ton of people watched it

361
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but we're so very proud of the work that we do.

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But now we gotta make our Russian dressing.

363
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So I'm gonna start dumping a bunch of little bowls

364
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
into a bigger bowl while explaining

365
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
what is in the little bowls,

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and how that comes together in the larger bowl.

367
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You've seen a cooking show.

368
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Kind of describes most of them.

369
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This is mayonnaise.

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It is white.

371
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:61,000
That's all I got for that one.

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Russian dressing, very typical on a Reuben,

373
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
very big in delis.

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I love getting a plate of latkes

375
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and then asking for Russian dressing on the side.

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That is my absolute favorite guilty pleasure thing.

377
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I used to end up at a lot of Jewish delis

378
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
at like two in the morning in various states of being.

379
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We add some pickles in there.

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We've got some very finely diced red onion as well.

381
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I would get the chopped liver plate.

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'd get latkes and I'd get a pastrami Reuben.

383
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Then I would just mash that all together.

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And two cups of black coffee.

385
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That is the ultimate deli order.

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Maybe a knish when I'm feeling extra frosty.

387
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
A little bit of Worcestershire sauce,

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
a little bit of beet juice, just for color.

389
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's gonna make it nice and pink.

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
A little bit of tomato paste.

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ketchup is typically not in a Russian dressing,

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but a lot of people think it is.

393
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm adding tomato paste in there.

394
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A lot of people use chili sauce,

395
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
which is like this old school condiment

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that almost nobody has any more,

397
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
really similar to ketchup.

398
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And then black pepper,

399
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
paprika.

400
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I dumped the paprika into the red wine vinegar.

401
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Then we're going to add vinegar in there

402
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and then I'm just gonna stir this up.

403
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is gonna be the nice condiment to our poutine.

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We got our Russian dressing.

405
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is tasting delicious.

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Wow.

407
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Did I fool them?

408
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
All right, I'm going to take these fries.

409
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I got these fries.

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We added them to cold oil and then we just heated it up.

411
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Link in the below, link in the thing.

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to kind of like take some

413
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
of these here Jarlsberg cheese cubes.

414
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Jarlsberg is great, man.

415
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's like the most Swiss tasting Swiss.

416
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, now we're pissing off the Swiss people.

417
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They're gonna come in there and be like in Switzerland,

418
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
we just call it cheese,

419
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and I'm like I get it.

420
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So we're going to add all these cheese cubes to it.

421
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We want to kind of keep 'em whole

422
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but get 'em in the oven so they melt in that residual heat

423
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and then the gravy's just going to blanket it.

424
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

425
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Some thick logs of fries.

426
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Shh, quiet, quiet!

427
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
All right, we're going to pop this in the oven, 500 degrees.

428
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Just like five minutes,

429
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
just to get that cheese sweatin'.

430
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:60,000
Then I'll be, I'll be back, you'll see.

431
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:60,000
You'll see me.

432
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll be around.

433
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you think any other food tuber chews as much

434
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
as I do while they're trying to host the cooking show?

435
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Half the show is me eating food and just being like,

436
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
thanks for stopping by.

437
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm gonna take this out of the oven.

438
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, this is actually looking exactly how I wanted.

439
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We still have like big old pockets of cheese.

440
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's something I love about poutine.

441
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You don't just get like the blankets of cheese on there.

442
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You get those big old fatty pockets of curds,

443
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
except we got Jarlsberg.

444
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Seriously, big Jarlsberg cheese fan.

445
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Now I'm gonna take all that brown corned beef gravy

446
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and just slather that all over the fries.

447
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, here we go.

448
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh yes.

449
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It looks like dog food, that's okay.

450
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now I'm gonna take some little pockets of sauerkraut.

451
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sauerkraut is one of my favorite absolute condiments.

452
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I mean, it's essentially kind of pickled fermented cabbage.

453
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm just gonna kind of dot this around the whole situation.

454
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're gonna get all that acid cutting through the fat

455
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of that beef right there.

456
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Also, Jarlsberg 'cause it's not a salty cheese, right?

457
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like we have a lot of salt in that gravy

458
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
coming from the sauerkraut,

459
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
coming from all over this plate, frankly.

460
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We've got sauerkraut on there

461
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and now we're gonna take some of this Russian dressing

462
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
that may or may not come out of this small tube.

463
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's like trying to pee out a kidney stone.

464
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
There we go.

465
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Get that Russian dressing all over there.

466
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I want to suck it out of the hole,

467
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but I shouldn't.

468
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do it.

469
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I got it, it was a pickle.

470
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm taking the cap off.

471
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
All right, great, I got that Russian dressing.

472
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Now I'm going to take a couple of pickled mustard seeds.

473
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know, for garnish.

474
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We haven't garnished this enough.

475
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Shh, I need to concentrate.

476
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Now we can take some green things.

477
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, just for kind of a plausible deniability

478
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
that there's some color on this.

479
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So here we go, like get some little greens on there.

480
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is fresh dill.

481
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Goes a lot to be on French fries sometimes.

482
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But other times as well.

483
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What I saying is dill go good with pickles!

484
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
A couple of these little bad boys there.

485
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is like a surrealist painting.

486
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is like when Dali was all whacked out

487
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
of his mind and he was just like,

488
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
mountains are melting.

489
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:60,000
And they're like, well, I'm sorry?

490
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:60,000
That's what this is.

491
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's like a plate of food

492
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
that's just been thrown in like a dishwasher.

493
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, I'm pretty proud of that.

494
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That looks honestly good as heck.

495
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's eat this damned thing.

496
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I can't wait to dig in.

497
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Was that natural?

498
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I feel insane with this on.
